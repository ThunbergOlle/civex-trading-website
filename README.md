# Civex Trading Website
This is a trading website designed and made for [Civex](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivEx/). :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### About :scroll:
The website will be a way for other people on the server to find deals and offers when they want to trade. Users can upload their trade offers or the things they want to get rid off and the place where you can make the trade. 
When enough data is gathered there will be price histories to see how prices on different items varies and how it goes for them, you will then be able to see what you should invest in on get rid off fast! :bar_chart:

The website itself should be easy to view and use and we should confuse the users with complicated interfaces ect. :blush:

### The project :file_folder:
The project is made in NodeJS and a type of html language called "ejs". For the database management we will use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) :heavy_check_mark:

I've built the folders in the project good so it's easy to navigate and check the files. If you are familiar to NodeJS I would really love if you'd contact me or make some issues and pullrequests! :clipboard:
